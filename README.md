# An essay on privacy

I've been working on this essay for a while and thought it might be a good idea to share it here. enjoy!

## Foreword

I know, I know, there are many essays on the topic of privacy nowadays, but here's my contribution. I would've made it longer but since it was a school assignment and had a word limit I couldn't. There are many topics I didn't get to write about in the essay, but it is still a good piece for someone who might not be familliar to this problem to understand the basics of it. I might expand on this essay sometime in the future, but for now, this is what I can provide. Hope you enjoy it!

## Privacy Conflicts in our Modern Day World

According to Statista, healthcare data breaches in the United States caused by hacking have increased more than thirteenfold since 2014. (Statista) Even before birth, tech companies can start tracking you without your choice to opt out. These problems are just some of the causes of modern-day privacy conflicts. Privacy is hard to maintain in today’s world. This essay will provide solutions for privacy conflicts that are only becoming more common as time goes on. Some people might say, "What if I don't have anything to hide?" But the truth is, everyone has something to hide, it is human nature. Have you ever connected to a cellular network? Ever clicked “Connect automatically” after connecting to your home WIFI? Used a credit card? Each of these are examples of normal things people do daily that might be the thin line between privacy and being completely exposed. Privacy is an important part of a reasonable human being, a violation of privacy is a violation of our human rights, and these are only becoming more common with new technologies being released, the fact that these rights are not taken seriously gravely affects our society, this must be solved.

One of the main issues that make this problem so hard to solve is the lack of awareness towards this topic, not that many people are technology professionals after all. But it should not be a problem to bring more awareness to the topic. For example, many people share things they do daily through social media. While this might appear harmless to most, it is not. Firstly, one is sharing their habits with everyone who sees their account. And secondly, one might also share their exact location through photos. Everything you post can be used against you. Bad actors can identify and locate people with things they post willingly on the internet. They can also fingerprint people and find out who they are, even if they do not reveal their faces. Ad companies owned by big tech companies might know exactly who you are by using the information they collected. But most of the time, they do not even have to use that information since the first time people create an account on most of these services they provide them with their face and full legal name. Most people, would not tell some creepy guy in the back of an alley where they live or went every day for the last year. If this is the case, then why do people hand this information off so easily to social media services? The reason for this is a widespread lack of awareness. More awareness is key to solving this problem. We cannot trust social media apps to help, since they get the money at the end of the day. Ad companies should disclose information about the data they collect, and governments should start more online privacy campaigns.

Another solution to this problem would be to have more government regulations regarding personal privacy. While Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence [...],” Many governments seem to not be protecting their citizen’s right to privacy, this is of utmost importance in today's world. Technology companies harvest personal data from their users, while that data might not be in use by bad actors now, it certainly can be later. Governments should be passing laws to prevent data harvesting, protecting the privacy of their citizens. It is not a matter of “if,” it is a matter of “when” the next massive data breach might happen (PwC), and if our governments do not put a stop to data harvesting soon, all the data that tech companies got from us will be one breach away from getting in the wrong hands and being used against us.

While the two solutions proposed above are valid and effective, one of the most important measures people can take is individual effort. Real privacy will not be here for a long time, so everybody should take measures to protect themselves and their privacy. Examples of what one can do to protect their privacy are the following: Using the “Tor Browser”. The Tor Browser is a web browser that protects you from censorship and maintains your privacy at all times (“About the Tor Project”). Not using Facebook or other platforms owned by Facebook, Facebook is known for violating its user’s privacy (FTC) so staying away from its services is a good decision you can make to protect your privacy. Using open-source software. Any software whose license follows the Open Source initiative’s Open source definition is open source and safer than using closed-source software. It has been proven that security by obscurity is less secure than security by transparency. Plus, open-source projects typically have more than hundreds of eyes on them; if a vulnerability is discovered in open source code, it is usually fixed within days. One example of these extra protections open source provides is the PHP backdoor attempt back in March of this year. Hackers tried to inject a backdoor into the source code of a popular scripting language for websites called  PHP, some contributors for the project noticed this and immediately rolled back the change. (Malwarebytes) These and many other measures are some things you can do to protect your privacy from prying eyes. 

In conclusion, nothing is private, companies harvest your data, governments are constantly monitoring everything you do, privacy is just an illusion, but everyone can help change this reality. Public awareness, government regulations, and individual efforts are just some solutions to slow down bad actors and keep people safe. These are all solutions we need to put forward as a team, not just a society. This is a fight against governments, big tech, and more. You can help us win this fight, what are you doing?
